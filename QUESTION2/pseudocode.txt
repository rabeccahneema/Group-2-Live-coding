Input: A list of programs (each with duration, allowed broadcast time, audience reach, and ad revenue).
Output: A time-based schedule showing which program is assigned to each time slot.

Steps:

1. Create an empty schedule covering all time slots of the day (e.g., 24 slots for 24 hours).

2. Define which time slots are considered prime-time (e.g., 6 PM to 10 PM).

3. Sort the list of programs based on audience reach and ad revenue, highest first.

4. For each program in the sorted list:

Check the time range it’s allowed to be broadcast.

Try to find a block of free time slots within that range that matches the program’s duration.

Give preference to prime-time slots for popular programs.

5. If a suitable slot is found, assign the program to those time slots in the schedule.

6. Mark those time slots as taken so other programs aren’t placed there.

7. Continue until all programs are considered or no free slots are left.

8. Return or display the final schedule showing which program plays at what time.
